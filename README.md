# py-sds011

This is a python 3 interface to the SDS011 air particulate density sensor. The
datasheet, which this implementation follows, can be found [here](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/parts/1/2/2/7/5/Laser_Dust_Sensor_Control_Protocol_V1.3.pdf).

My implementation extends the project https://github.com/ikalchev/py-sds011 adding interface to upload results on a DB, AQIcn and Thinspeak.


Depends on several modules. See requirement.txt for details.
